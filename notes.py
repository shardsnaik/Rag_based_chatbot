        "content": "Hi, Piles are a collection of swollen hemorrhoids and can be very painful. They occur in the rectum or anus and can cause severe pain that worsens when you sit down. They may also bleed while you have a bowel movement. The causes of piles are not completely understood but they can be caused by constipation, straining during bowel movements, obesity, chronic diarrhea, pregnancy, birth trauma (in babies), and certain medications like decongestants, antibiotics, and steroids. Treatment for piles includes avoiding constipation, using laxatives to relieve constipation, using hemorrhoid creams or suppositories to reduce inflammation and pain, using warm sitz baths to soothe the area, drinking plenty of water, and sometimes surgery. If you have severe pain or bleeding, see a doctor as soon as possible.",

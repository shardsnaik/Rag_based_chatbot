For best result please consult an internal medicine specialist who will perform a complete physical exam , history taking and further investigations like blood tests (hemogram , ESR , CRP , liver function test , kidney function test , LFT , etc.) to rule out any other underlying causes of pain . Hope this helps you take the right decision."
